# algoPortfolio
A Collection of Algorithmic Code written in two different versions (Python and C++) to demonstrate my coding prowess. Can also be used for educational purposes.

# Summary
Over the past several years, I've taken programming courses ranging from Introduction to C++ to Advanced Algorithms. What I've realized is that, in this age of generative AI tools, there will always be a need for simple step-by-step tutorials explaining how different algorithms are structured and why their logic works. 

# Languages
A majority of the code will be written in two different versions: C++ and Python. 

# Notes regarding Lecture Notes and Powerpoint Slides
I am currently rewriting them so, if you notice files going missing, it's because they are old information.

# Copyright
The code that I will release can be used for educational purposes but, if anyone wishes to use the code, must alter the code enough so that it isn't an exact copy of the original.
